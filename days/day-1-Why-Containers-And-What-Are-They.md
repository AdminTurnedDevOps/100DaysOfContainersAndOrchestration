## Before There Were VMs...

As with every new year that passes, new engineers and IT pros come into the industry. Whether they’re breaking into it right out of college or they decided to skip college and go straight to work. In any case, as with every new person comes fewer people that have worked in “older” infrastructure.

When engineers come into the world of tech now, they see a lot of:

- Containers
- Orchestration
- Automation

and overall abstraction.

Folks that are coming into tech in today’s world don’t want to sit on a datacenter floor and wire cables through various switches and routers. They don’t want to change out RAM on a server or dive into virtualization software.

They want to dive into the latest and greatest (cloud, containers, Kubernetes, etc.) and for good reason - because it’s the “hot” thing right now… and the “hot” thing leads to a better chance of getting a good job.

Although that’s fine, it can leave a lot to be desired for truly diving deep into containerization and orchestration.

Why?

Because the truth is - containers, Kubernetes, the cloud… it’s all based on (what feels like legacy in today’s world) legacy systems.

For example, servers are still servers in Kubernetes. Networking is still networking in Kubernetes. Storage is still storage in Kubernetes. Kubernetes isn’t creating any new foundations. It’s simply abstracting foundations, but you still need to know them.

Think about it like this…

Do you need to wire routers and switches in a datacenter if your organization is cloud based? No. Do you have to spend 18 hours in a datacenter solving network issues plugged into a Cisco router? No. Are the same problems we were solving plugged into a Cisco router for port issues in a datacenter the same port issues you’ll see in Kubernetes? **Yes**. Ports are ports. Routes are routes. Firewalls are firewalls.

Point being - the fundamentals and the foundation are still needed. Otherwise, you’re going to cause a massive amount of confusion to yourself.

That’s why I propose this…
