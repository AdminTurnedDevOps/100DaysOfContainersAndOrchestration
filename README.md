# 100DaysOfContainersAndOrchestration
Your go-to open source repo to learn containers (Docker, Podman, etc.) and Orchestration (Kubernetes, ECS, etc.) from start to finish.

## Why?
Containers, orchestration, and the overall landscape of running modern applications is changing.

When I first started working in tech, the innovative thing was to have a bunch of bash scripts, batch scripts (yes... batch), and PowerShell scripts run workloads.

We would put a couple of binaries (compiled code) on a server, run some commands or scripts to get them started, and boom... our app was up and running.

Now? We don't even need a dedicated bare-metal server to run our code anymore (wow... I've been working in tech for a long time).

Instead, we can just take a micro-sized binary (a container) and run it anywhere (even on our local computer).

So, why am I creating this project?

For a few reasons:
1. I've seen the transition from bare-metal to VMs to containers.
2. It's clear that containers are how we're running workloads today.
3. There are A LOT of different avenues you can do down when running containers.

The third reason above is the big reason why this open-source project is so important.

There are A LOT of ways to run and orchestrate containers in today's world... and it's not just Kubernetes.

There's also multiple different runtimes to run containers...

The reason for this project is to help you dive deep into all of the different avenues you can take to run containers.

## How?



More to come! This project is a WIP (started January 3rd, 2023).
